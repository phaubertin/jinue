# System Call Mechanisms

The microkernel supports the following mechanisms to invoke system calls. Not
all mechanisms are available on all CPUs. On initialization, before invoking any
system call, an application should look at the value of auxiliary vector number
11 (JINUE_AT_HOWSYSCALL) to determine the best supported system call mechanism:

* 0 for the interrupt-based mechanism
* 1 for the SYSCALL/SYSRET (fast AMD) mechanism
* 2 for the SYSENTER/SYSEXIT (fast Intel) mechanism

## Interrupt-Based Mechanism

A system call can be invoked by generating a software interrupt to interrupt
vector 128 (80h). The argument registers are mapped as follow:

* `arg0` maps to CPU register `eax`.
* `arg1` maps to CPU register `ebx`.
* `arg2` maps to CPU register `esi`.
* `arg3` maps to CPU register `edi`.

## SYSCALL/SYSRET (Fast AMD) Mechanism

A system call can be invoked by executing the `SYSCALL` CPU instruction.

* `arg0` maps to CPU register `eax`.
* `arg1` maps to CPU register `ebx`.
* `arg2` maps to CPU register `esi`.
* `arg3` maps to CPU register `edi`.

This system call is not supported by all CPUs.

## SYSENTER/SYSEXIT (Fast Intel) Mechanism

A system call can be invoked by executing the `SYSENTER` CPU instruction.

* `arg0` maps to CPU register `eax`.
* `arg1` maps to CPU register `ebx`.
* `arg2` maps to CPU register `esi`.
* `arg3` maps to CPU register `edi`.
* The return address must be set in the `ecx` CPU register.
* The user stack pointer must be set in the `ebp` CPU register.

This system call is not supported by all CPUs.
