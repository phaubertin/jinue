--- Issues:

- Pointer aliasing in hal_start()

- Stack alignment (?)

- e820 map validation: ensure we have memory starting at 0x100000

--- Roadmap

1  - System calls infrastructure + function naming (library), param validation

2  - Thread management (create, thread queue) and yield()

3  - IPC mechanism (doors) and file descriptors

4  - Memory and namespace management (process manager)

5  - Process management and fork()

6  - Interrupt handling, clock interrupt, clock

7  - Thread scheduler

8  - Image filesystem (process manager)

9  - vfork() and exec()

--- Design:

- process and thread management

- thread scheduler

- IPC mechanism

- interrupt handling

- Clock

- multiprocessor support -> ACPI tables (?)

- kernel debugging/tracing

- kernel objects

System calls:
    - Map page table
    - Invalidate TLB
    - IPC: send/receive/return
    - Clock: query, adjust
    - Thread: create/destroy, suspend/resume
    - Process: create/destroy
