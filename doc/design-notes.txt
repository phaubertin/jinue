Main IPC mechanism (summary): Solaris-style doors and filesystem namespace
managed by process manager like QNX.

IPC basic model:
    - Process performs a system call to process manager asking to create an
      IPC object, optionaly specifying a name.
    - Process manager checks:
        - that caller (security domain) is authorized to create an IPC object.
        - that caller is authorized to create a "system" IPC object if that
          was requested.
        - that caller is authorized to create an IPC object with that name.
        - that an IPC object with that name does not already exist.
        - what should be the security type of the IPC object.
    - If all checks out, process manager performs (a) system call(s) to the
      microkernel to create the IPC object, and create an owner reference for
      the caller and a reference for its own use.
    - If applicable, process manager creates a map entry that maps the requested
      name to the new reference, then returns.
    (...)
    - User process performs a system call to the process manager requesting
      a reference to the IPC object.
    - Process manager checks that caller security domain is authorized for that
      object security type.
    - If check OK, process manager creates a reference for the caller and
      returns it.
    - User process uses the new reference to make IPC calls to the IPC object
      owner.
    - When the user process is finished with the IPC object, it closes its
      reference. Reference is automatically closed when the process exits (TBD
      by the process manager or by the microkernel).

IPC function/method numbers:
    0x0+    (A) microkernel system calls
    0x400+  (B) process manager system calls
    0x1000  (C) SYSTEM_BASE
    0x8000  (D) USER_BASE

(A) Target is NULL, an IPC object or another kernel object. Valid target depends
    on function number.

(B) Target is NULL or an IPC object, maybe other object types. Valid target
    depends on function number. Message sent to Process manager. Process manager
    itself cannot call these.

(C) and (D) Target is an IPC object. Message sent to IPC object owner process
    (only process authorized to wait on this object).

(C) Only function numbers in this range are allowed for "system" IPC objects.
    creating a system IPC object is a priviledged operation (i.e. subject
    to check of security domain).

(D) Only function numbers in this range are allowed for "user" IPC objects.
